          GET: to request data from the server.
          POST: to submit data to be processed to the server.
          PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.
          PATCH: PATCH is similar to a PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only replace the content that you want to update.
          DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.
